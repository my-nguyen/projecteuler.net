  # Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm (from wikipedia) to find all prime numbers
  # up to a target number
  # This algorithm proves to be a vast improvement on my older prime-finding
  # algorithm: while the older version took 13 seconds, this new version took
  # less than 1 second.
  # This method finds all prime numbers from 2 up to size and stores them in an
  # array, with prime numbers represented as ON bit and non-prime as OFF
  def initialize(size)
    # first initialize all elements in array to TRUE
    @bools = Array.new(size+1, true)

    # numbers 0 and 1 are not primes
    @bools[0] = false
    @bools[1] = false

    # start with 2, the very first prime number
    2.upto(size) do |index|
      # only consider prime numbers
      if @bools[index]
        multiple = 2
        while (index*multiple <= size)
          # all multiples of a prime numbers (2p, 3p, 4p, etc) are not primes
          @bools[index*multiple] = false
          multiple += 1
        end
      end
    end
    @bools
  end

  # there's no need to create another array that contains only prime numbers
  # extracted from the array of bools (as in the previous version): Just look in
  # the array of bools for the target prime number.
  def index(target)
    # index to the entire bool array
    i = 1
    # index only up to target
    j = 0
    while (j < target)
      i += 1
      j += 1 if @bools[i]
    end
    i
  end

  # this method returns the sum of all the prime numbers within the bools array
  def sum()
    sum = 0
    # iterate the entire bools array
    @bools.each_index do |i|
      # only add to sum if bools at i is ON
      sum += i if @bools[i]
